This is a static, single page site for use in demoing code and process for the [Build Right: Frontend Tooling workshop](https://github.com/sparkbox/BR-Front-End-Tooling).

It's a fictional app called "Toolcase" â€” a simple list for developers and designers to showcase the tools they use for given tasks.

## Creating the project:

1. Clone this repo to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/sparkbox/br-frontend-demo.git`
2. Move into the project directory: `cd br-frontend-demo`
3. Install node modules: `npm install`


At the end of the workshop we will have built an app similar to this:
