# Exercise 6!

Now that we've seen what Webpack looks like, let's add Rollup and see what changes!

You'll need to:

- Make a `rollup.config.js`
- Point the entry at `/src/js/app.js`
- Point the destination at `/src/js/app.min.js`
- Add the Rollup Babel Plugin
- If you have time look at adding the Uglify plugin into Rollup!
